# DeepLearning_COVID19
PyTorch implementation of various state-of-the-art supervised deep learning models for the task of multi-class classification of COVID-19 from chest X-ray imaging. 

Architectures employed:
- ResNet 18 and 50
- VGG16 (batch norm)
- DenseNet-121

A Jupyter Notebook (COVID_classifier.ipynb), compatible with Google Colab, has been provided to allow replication of the results. 

TODO: add model weights.
